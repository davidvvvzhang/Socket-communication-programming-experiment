# TCP
This experiment consists of two parts:

1 TCP socket socket programming: realize the basic communication function between client and server (that is, a client and a server can carry out simple text communication).
  What you should type in terminal:
    g++ server.cpp -o server;
    ./server;
    g++ client.cpp -o client;
    ./client;

2 Design of chat program based on TCP-based chat program.
